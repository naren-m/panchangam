    let currentMuhurta: MuhurtaStatus
    let nextSignificantEvent: EventCompact
    let rahuKalam: TimeRange?
    let auspiciousnessScore: Float // 0.0-1.0
    let updatedAt: Date
}

struct TithiCompact {
    let number: Int
    let name: String
    let percentage: Float
    let quality: String // "Auspicious", "Neutral", "Challenging"
}
```

#### Smart Update Strategy
```yaml
Update Triggers:
  tithi_transition: "15 minutes before/after tithi change"
  nakshatra_transition: "30 minutes before/after nakshatra change"  
  significant_events: "Rahu kalam start/end, festival days"
  user_interaction: "When user taps complication"
  
Battery Optimization:

### Intelligent Caching Strategy
```yaml
Cache Hierarchy Levels:

Level 1 - Client Cache (1-7 days):
  apple_watch: "3 days basic panchangam + 1 day detailed"
  mobile_app: "7 days comprehensive + 30 days basic"
  web_browser: "1 day detailed + 7 days basic"
  calendar_addon: "30 days festival data + 7 days muhurtas"

Level 2 - CDN Edge (24 hours):
  static_assets: "Images, CSS, JS files with 1-year expiry"
  api_responses: "Location-based caching for popular cities"
  precomputed_data: "Major cities pre-calculated for next 24 hours"

Level 3 - API Gateway (6 hours):
  rate_limiting: "User request limits and throttling state"
  authentication: "JWT token validation cache"
  response_cache: "Identical request responses cached for 6 hours"

Level 4 - Application Cache (1-24 hours):
  redis_hot: "Current day data for top 100 cities (1 hour TTL)"
  redis_warm: "Next 7 days for top 1000 cities (6 hour TTL)"
  redis_cold: "Historical data and rare locations (24 hour TTL)"

Level 5 - Database Layer:
  postgres: "Configuration, user preferences, regional settings"
  ephemeris: "Raw astronomical data with infinite TTL"
  time_series: "Historical panchangam calculations"
```

### Database Architecture
```sql

    timezone VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    region VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_accessed TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    INDEX idx_coordinates (latitude, longitude),
    INDEX idx_region (region),
    INDEX idx_usage (usage_count DESC, last_accessed DESC)
);

CREATE TABLE panchangam_cache (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    location_id INTEGER REFERENCES locations(id),
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    calculation_method VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,

    date DATE NOT NULL,
    location_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    panchangam_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
) PARTITION BY RANGE (date);
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy
```yaml
Database Optimization:
  connection_pooling: "pgbouncer with 100 max connections"
  read_replicas: "3 read replicas across different regions"
  connection_distribution: "Read queries distributed, writes to primary"
  query_optimization: "EXPLAIN ANALYZE on all queries, sub-100ms target"

Cache Optimization:
  redis_cluster: "6-node cluster with auto-failover"
  memory_management: "LRU eviction with intelligent retention"
  connection_pooling: "Connection reuse across requests"
  data_compression: "GZIP compression for large responses"

Application Optimization:
  concurrent_processing: "Goroutines for parallel calculations"
  request_batching: "Batch multiple location requests"
  response_streaming: "Stream large datasets instead of buffering"
  resource_pooling: "Object pools for expensive calculations"

Monitoring & Analytics:
